# GGR472 Final Project:
 
This repository contains code for a website for GGR472. Our final project involves active transit in Toronto, specifically cycling. This website will allow stakeholders such as policymakers and the public to analyze the distribution of active transit infrastructure throughout the city, whether the use case is finding areas in need of better service, or finding out how equipped your neighbourhood is for active transit use. 


## Key repository contents (Needs to be updated)
- `data/pedcyc_collision_06-21.geojson`: Data file containing point locations of road collisions involving pedestrian and cyclists between 2006 and 2021 in Toronto
- `index.html`: HTML file to render the map
- `style.css`: CSS file for positioning the map interface, layout, style, and managing colours, etc.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file that creates and visualizes and hexgrid map based on the collision data
