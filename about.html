                    <h2>What is Active Transit Toronto?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Active Transit Toronto (ATT) initiative was created by three students, Abby, Joseph, and Eric, who share a common interest in transportation geography. We are all enrolled in the University of Torontoâ€™s Undergraduate Department of Geography and Planning, and we are all familiar with GIS. Our web map is designed to empower both Torontonians & policymakers with data-driven visualisations related to active transportation in Toronto, particularly cycling.

                    <h2>Why this Project?</h2>
                    <h4>Toronto's Automobile Reliance</h4>
                    <p>
                        Despite the progressive orientation of Toronto, most commuters still rely on single-occupancy vehicles. This heavy reliance on automobiles contributes to high traffic congestion due to the space inefficiency of cars, high greenhouse gas emissions, and negative health consequences for commuters as automobiles are a sedentary form of transit. Our web map allows people to highlight infrastructure gaps in active transit with an ultimate goal of reinforcing the importance of implementing active transit as a solution to various modern urban challenges.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Helping Citizens</h4>
                    <p>
                        We hope that by providing accessible visualizations of important information regarding active transit infrastructure, such as bike station locations, we can encourage and assist residents in implementing active transit in their daily commutes. Our web map can also assist citizens or social movements in identifying and bargaining for more active transit investment within their neighbourhoods. This web map serves as a tool to help support a just transition towards more sustainable, healthy, and efficient modes of travel.
                    </p>
					 <h4>Assisting Policymakers</h4>
                    <p>
						Our web map is also a useful resource for policymakers. Our visualizations and interactivity can allow policymakers to quickly identify and quantify disparities in access and potential areas in need of further active transit investment.

                <!-- Why Does Active Transit Matter Section -->
                <section id="why-active-transit-matters">
                    <h2>Why Does Active Transit Matter?</h2>
                    <h4>Sustainability & Climate Consciousness</h4>
                    <p>
                        Single-occupancy vehicles account for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions throughout the world. Active transit offers a sustainable solution to urban environments, reinforcing progressive and forward-thinking values and planning. A large shift in commutes made by active transit can assist Toronto in reaching its net zero goals as well as increasing air quality for residents. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Health Benefits</h4>
                    <p>
                        Active transit use has been shown to have a number of health benefits for users, especially compared to sedentary automobile trips. Cycling and walking increases physical activity, helping people reach weekly physical activity guidelines. Active transit use has been shown to decrease the prevalence of risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension. Active transit also helps strengthen bone density and increase muscle mass, which is especially important for vulnerable populations such as the elderly.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Spatial Equity</h4>
                    <p>
                        Spatial equity is an important but often overlooked aspect in an equity lens. Ensuring all residents in Toronto have choice of mode is an important goal for ensuring equity in the city. No community should lack access to active transit infrastructure, especially given the health benefits. Investing in active transit infrastructure improves the mobility, health, and sustainability of transit, while also increasing spatial equity.
